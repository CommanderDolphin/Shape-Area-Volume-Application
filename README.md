# Shape-Area-Volume-Application
A modular program in the C language for the calculation of the area/perimeter/volume of 2D and 3D shape with a makefile
<b>1.3  Features<br/></b>
Follow  the  “Steps  to  Develop  Large  Applications”  as  discussed  in  the  lecture
(slide 56 Unit 2) to develop your application.  It must have the following features:<br/>
•Distributed over suitable files (must be more than one) - your module iden-
tification should be reflected in the file structure.<br/>
•Declarations for each module should be available in separate header files.<br/>
•Header files must have include guards.<br/>
•Your program must define and use at least one pre-processor macro with
parameter(s).<br/>
•Suitable text-based user interface in main()<br/>
•You  must  provide  your  own  Makefile  (this  must  be  written  by  yourself  -
no IDE generated Makefile will be accepted).Your Makefile must have the
following features:<br/>
        –Use separate targets for compilation and linking.<br/>
        –Use at least one make file variable.<br/>
        –Provide a “clean” target that removes temporary files, object files and
        executables created by this Makefile.<br/>
        –Doesnot use any implicit rules<br/>
        –Running make without a target should compile & link your application
        and also automatically execute your application.<br/>
