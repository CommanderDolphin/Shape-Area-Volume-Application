# Shape-Area-Volume-Application
A modular program in the C language for the calculation of the area/perimeter/volume of 2D and 3D shape with a makefile
<b>1.3  Features</b>
Follow  the  “Steps  to  Develop  Large  Applications”  as  discussed  in  the  lecture
(slide 56 Unit 2) to develop your application.  It must have the following features:
•Distributed over suitable files (must be more than one) - your module iden-
tification should be reflected in the file structure.
•Declarations for each module should be available in separate header files.
•Header files must have include guards.
•Your program must define and use at least one pre-processor macro with
parameter(s).
•Suitable text-based user interface in main()
•You  must  provide  your  own  Makefile  (this  must  be  written  by  yourself  -
no IDE generated Makefile will be accepted).  Your Makefile must have the
following features:
        –Use separate targets for compilation and linking.
        –Use at least one make file variable.
        –Provide a “clean” target that removes temporary files, object files and
        executables created by this Makefile.
        –Doesnot use any implicit rules
        –Running make without a target should compile & link your application
        and also automatically execute your application.
